            <p class="desc">Are you struggling to lose weight no matter how much you diet or exercise? Turns out, <strong>it's not your fault</strong>.</p>
            <p class="desc">A 2022 study published in Nature Medicine of 52,000 women and men, the largest of its kind in humans, found just one common factor in every overweight man and woman. <strong>Low brown adipose tissue levels</strong>! They also found common in every skinny person were high brown adipose tissue levels.</p>
            <p class="desc">Brown adipose tissue (BAT) also know as brown fat, is not fat at all. Its not a fat storer but a <strong>fat shrinker</strong>. Its brown color comes from its densely packed mitochondria which work 24/7 to <strong>burn calories</strong> from your fat stores and the food you eat into pure, natural energy.</p>
            <p class="desc">Even though BAT makes up a fraction of your weight, it can burn up to <strong>300 times</strong> more calories than any other cell in your body!</p>
