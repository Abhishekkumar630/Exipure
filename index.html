            <p class="my-3">Hi! My name is Sheryl. Iâ€™m happily married, and a mother of five. I have always been physically active all my life but things changed after hitting 35.</p>
            <p>I began to experience changes in my body. I noticed that I have been staying up late at night as I couldnâ€™t sleep. I was eating more than I should and donâ€™t get satisfied and I started to long for sweet and salty foods.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes I would sneak downstairs at 1 AM to see what I can munch from the fridge. I thought it was okay, but I noticed that my curves and hourglass figure started to fade away, yet I still couldnâ€™t stop. ðŸ˜ž</p>
            <p>I tried everything, but nothing seemed to work for me. I was feeling hopeless when I found out about this Tropical Secret. I was skeptical at first but having nothing to lose, I gave it a shot. And thatâ€™s when my journey began.</p>
            <p>Today, Iâ€™m back with my old self wearing my old jeans and confident with my body. I will be sixty this year, yet I am still energetic as ever. The fun part? No one would think that Iâ€™m already a grandmother of three ðŸ˜„
